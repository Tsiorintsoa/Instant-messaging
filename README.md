# Instant Messaging Application

This is a simple instant messaging application where users can send messages in real-time. 
You have the option to start the server (ServerSideSocket.java) and clients (ClientSideSocket.java) manually, or use the provided `windowsLauncher.bat` script to start everything automatically.

The windowsLauncher will start a server on "localhost" url and connect two clients.

## Features
- Real-time messaging between clients
- Server and client communication through Sockets (from java.net)
- Support for manual or automatic startup
